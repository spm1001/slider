# Instructions for ending a session working on a project

1. Please tidy up any rogue files or edits that are leftover
2. Please update CLAUDE.md to reflect the current state of the codebase, and also add updates on progress.
3. Update SESSION_NOTES.md, so that it can be used by a new instance of Claude Code to get up to speed with what was done last time and what is on the agenda for the next session. 
4. If there are uncommitted changes that relate to very different conceptual tasks, then try and break them up into distinct commits.
