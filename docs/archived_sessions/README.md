# Archived Sessions

This directory contains completed session documents from the structured session management system.

## File Naming Convention

Session documents follow the format: `THIS_SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Example: `THIS_SESSION_2025-08-18.md`

## Purpose

These archived sessions serve as:
- **Historical record** of project development progression
- **Context for future sessions** when reviewing past decisions  
- **Learning reference** for understanding problem-solving approaches
- **Project documentation** showing how features were developed

## Organization

Files are organized chronologically by date. Each file contains:
- Session objectives and planning
- Progress log with timestamps
- Technical discoveries and solutions
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Decisions made and their reasoning
- Key learnings and insights

## Integration with Session Management

These archives are created during the closedown procedure:
1. **THIS_SESSION.md** is completed during active session
2. **CLOSEDOWN.md** procedure moves it to this directory
3. **LAST_SESSION_SUMMARY** is created for next session startup
4. **SESSION_NOTES.md** receives condensed session summary

## Usage Tips

When referencing archived sessions:
- Look for similar technical challenges or patterns
- Review decision-making processes for consistency
- Extract reusable approaches or solutions
- Identify recurring blockers or issues that need systemic solutions

These archives are a valuable resource for understanding project evolution and maintaining development momentum across sessions.
