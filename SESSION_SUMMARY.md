# Session Summary - Google Apps Script Development

This file tracks the current session progress and key findings for Claude Code resumption.

## Current Status: OAUTH PROBLEM SOLVED ✅ - READY FOR FINAL TESTING

### Major Accomplishments ✅
- **Full automation pipeline working**: Deploy → Execute → Retrieve Logs
- **Apps Script project deployed**: All 7 .gs files functional
- **OAuth authentication configured**: Web client with proper scopes
- **Cloud Logging API integrated**: Programmatic log access working
- **Security audit completed**: API keys and OAuth scopes cleaned up

### Last Working Commands
```bash
npm run deploy    # Deploy code changes
npm test         # Run font swap test  
npm run logs     # Get detailed execution logs
```

### OAUTH PROBLEM SOLVED ✅

**Root Cause Identified**: VSCode blocks ALL localhost traffic on laptop
- `curl -I http://localhost:32790` hangs with VSCode running
- `curl -I http://localhost:32790` returns "Empty reply" with VSCode closed
- This blocked OAuth redirects from completing

**Solution Implemented**: HTTP Server OAuth Flow
- **oauth-server.js**: Manual URL copying with real HTTP server
- **oauth-auto.js**: Fully automated flow that opens browser automatically
- Both solutions work even with VSCode running
- **TESTED SUCCESSFULLY** ✅

**New Workflow**:
```bash
npm run auth     # Fully automated - opens browser, you click Allow
npm run deploy   # Deploy code changes
npm test         # Run tests and get results  
npm run logs     # Get detailed execution logs
```

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test fully automated OAuth flow (`npm run auth`)
- [ ] Clean up temporary OAuth scripts
- [ ] Update documentation for new OAuth process
- [DEFERRED] Research standalone GCP project migration

### Additional Notes
- **Tmux mouse mode**: Enabled and persisting in ~/.tmux.conf
- **User has one remaining topic** to discuss after testing OAuth

### Key Files Modified This Session
- `deploy-web-manual.js` - Enhanced with proper scopes
- `get-logs-programmatically.js` - Working Cloud Logging integration  
- `run-test-and-get-logs.js` - Clean test execution
- `package.json` - Updated npm scripts
- `.env` - Cleaned up API key configuration
- `audit-oauth-scopes.js` - Security audit script created
- `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md` - OAuth security architecture documented

### Project URLs
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/spm1001/slider
- **Apps Script**: https://script.google.com/d/1I2dUX4hBHie4JvxELe5Mog8PxHXRWLUDACYzw94NqMrQr-YGawsNsouu/edit
- **Test Presentation**: 1_WxqIvBQ2ArGjUqamVhVYKdAie5YrEgXmmUFMgNNpPA

### Security Status ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ API key permissions minimized (Apps Script + Drive only)
- ✅ OAuth scopes cleaned up (removed cloud-platform, drive.scripts, script.deployments)
- ✅ IP restrictions added to API key
- ✅ All secrets in environment variables

### Ready for Resumption
The automated workflow is fully functional. Main remaining task is understanding and fixing the OAuth localhost interference to make the development process robust and professional.
